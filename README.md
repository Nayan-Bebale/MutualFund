# Smart Saver: Best Mutual Funds for You!

## Introduction
Welcome to Smart Saver, your go-to platform for making informed mutual fund investments! In this README, we'll provide an overview of our project, its objectives, and how you can contribute.

## Problem Statement
### Statement 10: Revolutionizing Wealth Management: Insights and Predictions for Mutual Funds

**Description:** The problem domain concerns wealth management for the common middle-class people, focusing on Mutual Funds. While there are various techniques for wealth management like FDs, Stocks Trading, Crypto, etc., they often require significant capital and involve risk factors. Mutual funds, on the other hand, pool money from multiple investors to invest in a diversified portfolio of securities, offering potential returns with reduced risk.

**Expected Solution:** Our goal was to provide descriptive analysis of Mutual Funds data, make predictions for future performance, develop a dashboard for data visualization, and create an AI-based recommendation system for selected inputs.

## Our Solution
We're proud to introduce Smart Saver, a platform dedicated to assisting middle-class families in making informed mutual fund investments. Here's what we've achieved:
- Data-driven analysis and predictive modeling of Mutual Funds.
- Identification of top-performing mutual funds based on risk level, expense ratio, and historical returns.
- Essential tools including the 50-30-20 calculator for salary allocation and SIP calculator for monthly investment planning.

## Future Plans
Our journey doesn't end here! We're committed to:
- Expanding services to cater to diverse financial needs.
- Generating revenue through subscription fees, consulting, and partnerships.
- Democratizing wealth-building opportunities for middle-class families.
