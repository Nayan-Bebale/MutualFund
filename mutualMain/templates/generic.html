								(SIPs).</li>

							some fluctuations or prefer stability?</li>
						<li><strong>Define Your Goals:</strong> What are you saving for? Retirement, child's
							education, dream vacation? This helps pick the right fund.</li>
						<li><strong>Choose Your Platform:</strong> Invest directly through Asset Management
							Companies (AMCs) or use online platforms (ensure they're SEBI-registered).</li>
						<li><strong>Pick Your Mutual Fund:</strong> Research and compare funds based on their
							investment objective, past performance, and expense ratio.</li>
